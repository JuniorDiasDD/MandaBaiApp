    "text_terms_of_use":"<b>Article 1-Identity of the entrepreneur</b><br><br>\nWe are MandaBai Family Support Service, registered in the Trade Register of the Chamber of Commerce Rotterdam, under number 77725247. You can contact us in writing by the Grote Beer 138, 3067 TT Rotterdam (ZH), via e -mail.or via phone.\n\n<br><br><b>Article 2-Applicability</b><br><br>\nThese terms and conditions apply if you buy or have purchased something from us online. We therefore bring these general conditions to your attention in various ways, so that you can easily consult them. It may be that we offer separate conditions for a product, service or promotion. In that case, these general terms and conditions also apply.\n\n<br><br><b>Article 3-The offer</b><br><br>\nWe describe the products and services that we offer in sufficient detail. We also mention any conditions that apply. This is how we try to prevent misunderstandings. We also make a reservation for price changes and typing errors. For actions, Op = Op. There is also the possibility that certain actions may be restricted in respect of the quantity of products that can be purchased. We reserve the right to change discount actions at any time and / or to refuse an order. Discounted articles are for home use only, not for trade purposes. Reselling is therefore prohibited.\n\n<br><br><b>Article 4-Your profile</b><br><br>\nTo place an order with us, you must create a profile. You warrant that the information you provide to us is accurate and complete and that you will update this information to keep it accurate and complete. You are responsible for keeping the login details of your profile secret. This means that you are also liable for all use that, as a result of actions and / or omissions attributable to you, are made via your profile of the website. We therefore ask you to treat your login details confidentially and only to use them for your own use. As soon as you know or have reason to suspect that your profile has come into the hands of unauthorized persons, you must inform us immediately. This does not affect your obligations to immediately take effective measures yourself, for example by changing your password. MandaBai is not liable for damage that in any way results from or relates to unauthorized use of your profile, unless this damage is the result of circumstances attributable to MandaBai. MandaBai reserves the right to temporarily and permanently block and / or remove your profile, under serious circumstances, for example when several fake orders are placed or orders are not picked up.\n\n<br><br><b>Article 5-The agreement</b><br><br>\nWhen you place an order with us online we will check it and confirm it by e-mail. In the confirmation we try to describe your order as completely as possible. If you discover errors in this confirmation, it is important that you contact us as soon as possible. You can find our contact details on www.MandaBai.com and in the confirmation of your order. It is also important that you save the confirmation of your order well (digitally).\n\n<br><br><b>Article 6-Right of withdrawal</b><br><br>\nIf you have purchased a product from us that you are not satisfied with, you may return it to us within 14 days of receipt. This does not apply to products that fall under Article 10 of these conditions.\n\n<br><br><b>Article 7-Obligations during reflection period</b>\nDuring the 14 day reflection period, you may unpack or use the product as you would in the shop. It is therefore important that the product is in 'store state' when you return it. If this is not the case, it is possible that you will receive no, or less, money back.\n\n<br><br><b>Article 8-Shipping costs in case of withdrawal</b><br><br>\nThe shipping costs for return are at your own expense. It is also possible to return the product for free at the nearest MandaBai store in your area.\n\n<br><br><b>Article 9-MandaBai's obligations in the event of withdrawal</b><br><br>\nYou must indicate within 14 days after the placement of your order that you want to return a product, excluded products for withdrawal are products listed under.\n\n<br><br> Article 10 Then we will refund you as soon as possible but no later than 14 days after the cancellation of the purchase.\n<br><br>You (the person who uses our transfer services) bear the direct costs of returning the product. It is also possible to receive a new product if it is still available. In case you return the product to a MandaBai store, you will receive a confirmation on the spot and you will immediately receive a new product or your purchase price\n\n<br><br><b>Article 10. Exclusion of right of withdrawal</b><br><br>\nYou can not return certain types of products due to safety and hygiene regulations. These are for example products that:<br>\n- can spoil and / or have a limited shelf life; - be clearly personal in nature; - are sealed and are not suitable to be returned for reasons of health protection or hygiene and of which the seal has been broken after delivery; - specially designed for you or made to measure.\n\n<br><br><b>Article 11-The price\n</b><br><br>The price of the products on our website are always listed excluding VAT. For some products, a daily price or a price per weight unit applies. With such products it may happen that the final price of the weighed / purchased product is (slightly) higher or lower than the price indicated at the time you place the order. In that case, the actual price will be charged upon delivery. In all cases, the delivery price is the final price. To use our transfer service, you pay a fee of € 7.00, € 9.00 or € 11.00, depending on the amount spent. If you want your order delivered at home, we charge € 4.00 delivery costs. These costs appear in your shopping basket before you place the order definitively\n\n<br><br><b>Article 12-Conformity and guarantee</b><br><br>\nWe think it is important that you receive a good product. If this is not the case, you can contact us. You can find our contact details on www.MandaBai.nl and in the confirmation of your order.\n\n<br><br><b>Article 13-Delivery and execution</b><br><br>\nYour order will be executed by our administration department and by the nearest MandaBai store in your area. The delivery time differs depending on the time you place your order and is a maximum of 24 hours.\n<br><br>MandaBai reserves the right to cancel an order in the event that a situation of force majeure prevents the delivery, such as in extreme weather conditions, employee strikes and default by suppliers of MandaBai. MandaBai is not liable for this.\n\n<br><br><b>Article 14-Payment</b><br><br>\nPayment will take place upon receipt of your order. You have the obligation to report inaccuracies in the provided or stated payment details to us immediately.\n\n<br><br><b>Article 15-Complaints</b><br><br>\nAny complaints about your order and the handling thereof can be made known by e-mail or by telephone. Our contact details can be found on the website www.MandaBai.nl and are included in the confirmation of your order.\n\n<br><br><b>Article 16-Age limit</b><br><br>\nOnly persons of 18 years and older can place orders via our website. If the order contains alcoholic products, tobacco products or medicines and there is doubt about your age, our deliveryman or employee will ask for your proof of identity.\n\n<br><br><b>Article 17-Abuse</b><br><br>\nIf it turns out that you are abusing the services offered by MandaBai, for example by placing orders but not collecting them, we will (temporarily) block your MandaBai account or even delete it. We will keep your name, email address and IP address to prevent you from misusing our company services.\n\n<br><br><b>Article 18-Applicable law and competent court</b><br><br>\n\nDutch law is exclusively applicable to these general conditions. Any dispute concerning these general conditions will be submitted exclusively to the competent court in Rotterdam.\n",
